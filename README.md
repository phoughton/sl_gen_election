# Python Streamlit - General Election Data Explorer

Lets you visualise data from recent general elections. You can then sort, filter or group the data as you wish.

For example, 
grouping by 'Main party name' and sorting by 'Candidate vote count' can you parties that received a lot of votes but few or even no seats in parliament.

## Run the code
```bash
streamlit run gen_election_filter.py
```

Selecting items in the first table will cause a secondary table to appear, these items can be downloaded (as a spreadsheet) if needed (a button will appear).

This is available [online, hosted by Streamlit](https://uk-general-election-data-viewer.streamlit.app/).
